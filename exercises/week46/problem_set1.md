### Week 46 Graph Practice Exercises

## Part 1: Loading and Understanding Spatial Networks
Using the California Road Network (CA-road) from networkrepository.com:
```python
# Example loading code
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
from urllib.request import urlretrieve
urlretrieve("https://networks.skewed.de/net/ca_road/files/ca-road.edges", "ca-road.edges")
```

1. **Basic Spatial Network Analysis**
- Load the CA road network 
- Calculate basic network statistics:
  * Number of nodes and edges
  * Average degree
  * Network diameter
  * Average path length
- Compute node distances using provided coordinates
- Create a visualization of a subset of the network (e.g., one city area)

2. **Spatial Network Properties**
- Identify nodes that act as hubs
- Calculate spatial metrics:
  * Geographic distance vs network distance correlation
  * Node density in different regions
  * Degree distribution analysis

## Part 2: Multipartite Graph Construction & Analysis
Using a subset of the CA road network, create a multipartite graph similar to GSNE:

3. **Building a Multipartite Network**
```python
import networkx as nx

# Create a multipartite graph
G = nx.MultiDiGraph()

# Add different types of nodes
cities = [(0, {'type': 'city', 'pop': 100000}),
         (1, {'type': 'city', 'pop': 150000})]
highways = [(2, {'type': 'highway', 'speed': 65}),
           (3, {'type': 'highway', 'speed': 55})]
stations = [(4, {'type': 'station', 'traffic': 1000})]

G.add_nodes_from(cities)
G.add_nodes_from(highways)
G.add_nodes_from(stations)
```

4. **Multipartite Network Analysis**
- Create edges between different node types based on distance
- Implement functions to:
  * Get nodes of a specific type
  * Calculate connectivity between different node types
  * Analyze feature distributions per node type

## Part 3: Matrix Representations
Working with the multipartite graph created above:

5. **Matrix Construction**
```python
# Create different adjacency matrices for each node type pair
def create_adjacency_matrices(G):
    node_types = ['city', 'highway', 'station']
    matrices = {}
    for type1 in node_types:
        for type2 in node_types:
            if type1 != type2:
                # Create sparse matrix for this pair
                matrices[f'{type1}-{type2}'] = create_sparse_matrix(G, type1, type2)
    return matrices
```

6. **Feature Matrix Operations**
- Create feature matrices for each node type
- Practice sparse matrix operations
- Implement distance-based edge weight calculations

## Part 4: Mini-Project: Simplified GSNE Data Structure

7. **Implement the GSNE Data Structure**
Create a simplified version of the data structure needed for GSNE:
```python
class SimpleGSNE:
    def __init__(self):
        self.node_types = []
        self.feature_matrices = {}
        self.adjacency_matrices = {}
    
    def add_node_type(self, type_name, features):
        # Add a new node type with its features
        pass
    
    def add_edges(self, type1, type2, edges):
        # Add edges between two node types
        pass
    
    def get_neighbors(self, node_id, node_type):
        # Get neighbors of a node of specific type
        pass
```

### Deliverables for Saturday:
1. Python notebook with:
   - CA road network analysis
   - Multipartite graph implementation
   - Matrix operations examples
   - SimpleGSNE class implementation
2. Discussion of:
   - Challenges in handling spatial networks
   - Differences between regular and multipartite graphs
   - Matrix operation efficiency considerations

### Key Resources:
1. NetworkX documentation: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/
2. California Road Network: https://networkrepository.com/roadNet-CA.php
3. SciPy sparse matrix documentation: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html

This revised set of exercises:
- Focuses purely on Python implementation
- Uses readily available network data
- Emphasizes spatial and multipartite network concepts
- Builds toward GSNE implementation
- Practices with real-world network data
